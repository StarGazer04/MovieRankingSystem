    - Set up AWS account:
        - Cloud watch alerts
        - S3 bucket for movie images
        - RDS for movie information

    - Information learned:
        * S3 bucket: Stores Object data such as images and documents for Movie System data
        * RDS database: Stores structured data (tables, users, relationships) for user information


03/01/2025 - VERY IMPORTANT

    - Set up Django backend:
        - created a Django project (MovieRankSite) and an app (MovieRankSystem). 
            - Django documentation for project and app directoies/files:
                - Project Folder: MovieRankSite/ 
                    * This is the overall Django project, acting as the "container" for everything.
                    * settings.py – Configuration file (e.g., database, installed apps, etc.).
                    * urls.py – Defines project-level URL routing.
                    * wsgi.py / asgi.py – Handles deployment settings.
                    * __init__.py – Marks the folder as a Python package.
                    * pycache/ – Stores compiled Python files for efficiency.
                - App Folder: MovieRankSystem/
                    * An app is a modular component inside the project.
                    * models.py – Defines the database structure (tables).
                    * views.py – Handles requests and returns responses.
                    * urls.py – Defines app-specific URL routing.
                    * migrations/ – Stores database migration files.
                    * admin.py – Manages admin panel setup.
                    * apps.py – App configuration.
                    * tests.py – Contains test cases.
                    * __init__.py – Marks the folder as a package.
    - Modified App urls.py (URL routing for app)
        - Created MovieRankSystem to define URL patterns for the app
        * Maps the root URL to views.index
    - Modified views.py (handling requests)
        - Added an index function that takes an HTTP request and returns a response 
            * When a user visits /MovieRankSystem/Django calls index() 
            * HttpReponse() creates a plain text response that is sent to browser
    - Modified project urls.py (global URL configuration)
        - Linked project to the app 
        * Tells django to load the apps urls.py when /MovieRankSystem/ is accessed 


03/02/2025

    - Set up Static folder inside LumaRank to store JS and CSS files
    - Set up Template folder inside LumaRank to store HTML files 
    - modified views.py and urls.py inside LumaRank to direct users to correct HTML files with a url change
    - modifed HTML files to reference static CSS and JS files

03/04/2025
    - Set up Django admin account
    - set up register authentication for users
    - Modify register.html file to update UI/UX design
    - Password error handeling 

    - Information learned:
        - Forms in django
        - Passing in HTML form into Django form
        - Pass in variables into rendered HTML documents 
        - Creating a model 
            * a model defines a dataset in Django. we used "model = User" to define a built in User model django has stored and defiend what fields of it we need.

03/05/2025
    - set up login authentication for users
    - Re-defiend urls files to seperate login and register page
    
    - Infomration learned:
        - How Django processes url patterns
            * When Django starts the server, it loads all URL patterns including whats inside 'include()' and builds a lookup table that includes the Name and full path. If user types URL, then Django will check the first parameter
              string and not 'Name'. For {% url ... %} and redirect(), Django will look for 'Name' and compare both in the lookup table. if Name is found in 'include()' then Django will add paths(first parameter) together.

              ex. user types url: '/LumaRank/login'. Django will check top level first (/LumaRank/), to which it finds a match in project urls.py. It then enters the 'include' and looks for 'login/' inside it
                  If it finds 'login/' it will load the view specified in the path argument in urls.py

              ex. user is redirected to 'login'. Django knows the url patterns when the server loaded from the lookup table. it looks for 'login' in the table and will try to try to find a match. Django will load the specified view in the path argument
                  if there is a match.

        - Capturing HTML form inputs individually
        - Name field in HTML input tag
            * used to reference form elements
        - Set up error messages for login and registration processes
        - authentication() and login() standard methods in django
        - Determining if user is already logged in or not 

03/06/2025
    - re-organized Search.html and Search.css
    - Created searchMovies() in search.js
        *listens for input in search bar. If there is input then a timeout call is cleared and then created. Timeout will Call timerFunction() in search.js if user does not type for X seconds.
    - Created listenTimer() in search.js
        *acts as the function call inside the timeout. searches for movie results from TMDB API, and dynamically adds the searched results inside the search popup.
    - Set up TMDB API

    - Information learned:
        - API calling using the TMDB API
            *fetching
        - Processing JSON return values
        - setTimeout() function call
            *waits x ms, then executes the function inside

03/07/2025
    - Quality of life changes for Search.html and Search.css
        - Made search box smaller
        - Re-organized serach results 
    - Created the 'add' button
    - Configured 'add' button dynamically in search.jss
        - When user clicks on the button, its corresponding movie is printed to the dev consol

    -Information learned:
        - document.querySelectorAll('.class') and document.getElementById('id') only find elements that already exist in the DOM when the script runs.
          If elements are added dynamically later (e.g. through TMDB API call), those calls will return an empty NodeList, and event listeners won’t attach.

PLANNING BOARD:
    - Test Search feature
    - Configure AWS RDS with django
    - User permissions
